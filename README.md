Today, I whipped up a Random Password Generator. It was pretty simple, but super satisfying!

Technologies Used:
#HTML

#CSS

#JavaScript

Here’s what I tackled:

✅ User Interface: Designed a clean layout with CSS to ensure the generator looks great on any device. The container is styled with rounded corners and shadow effects for a modern touch.

✅ Password Generation: Wrote a JavaScript function to generate random passwords including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. This ensures highly secure passwords.

✅ Copy Functionality: Implemented a feature to copy the generated password to the clipboard with a click, using a temporary input element to avoid visual selection.

✅ Responsive Design: Ensured the entire layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes with responsive CSS.
